# Algorithms data-structures end-assignment
This Java application processes a dataset containing information about books, such as title, author, rating, and publication date. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to execute various algorithms on the dataset and display the results and duration of the algorithms' execution.
## Features

The application supports the following algorithms:

* Sort books by title: Sorts the books in alphabetical order by their titles.
* Search book by title: Searches for a book in the dataset using its title.
* Average rating by author: Calculates the average rating of all books written by a specific author.
* Find books with a specific rating: Finds all books in the dataset that have a specific rating.

The application also provides basic manipulation methods for the dataset:

* Retrieve a book by its index in the dataset.
* Add a new book to the dataset.
* Delete a book by its index in the dataset.
* Update a book at a specified index with a new book.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
* Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-dataset-processor.git
```
2. Open the project in your IDE.

3. Build the project and run the Main.java class to launch the GUI.

### Usage

4. Click the "Run Algorithms" button to execute the algorithms on the dataset.
5. The results and duration of the algorithms' execution will be displayed in the output area.

## Dataset

The books.csv file contains the dataset used in this application. Each line in the file represents a book, with the following comma-separated fields:

* Title
* Author
* Rating (0-5 scale)
* Publication date (YYYY format)
